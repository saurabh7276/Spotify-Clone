I have created a SPOTIFY CLONE which is bit different from Original, I Have tried to implement responsiveness to it, and made it look good in all type of device,

to run this code you have to make some changes :
1. search for port in html and js file and update it it is by default 5500 change it to your own port
2. if you want to add more songs ;
    a. make a folder in songs folder
    b. add json file and edit as per your title and decription
    c. add cover.jpg to it as cover picture (it should be named same as cover.jpg of size 300x300px)
3. it is recommended to use vs code.
